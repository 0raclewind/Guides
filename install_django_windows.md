### Having trouble installing pip? 
This assumes you installed Python version 2.7 successfully. To test, open command prompt and type:

```
> python	 
>>> exit() 
```
If you can do the above, you have python installed on your computer. 

## Having trouble installing PIP? 
Let's try another method:

1. Save the ["ez_setup.py" file](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py) to your desktop. 

2. Open Command Prompt and do:
	1. `cd Desktop`
	2. `python ez_setup.py`
	3. `easy_install pip`

3. Now pip should work system wide. `pip install virtualenv` and `pip freeze`

That will have pip installed for you. Try it out.



Cheers!
